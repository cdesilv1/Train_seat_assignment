# Train_seat_assignment
This project is intended to be an algorithm for the best method to assign seating to individuals and groups on a train. 

Things this algorithm will take into equation:

0) Spaces between groups of people so a certain amount of privacy is prioritised
0) Seat assignments will be considered to widely space out the people/groups that reserve seats earlier
0) Cancellations
0) Various Train seat geometries
